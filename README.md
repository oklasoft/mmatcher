# mmatcher - Multiple Matcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oklasoft/mmatcher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/oklasoft/mmatcher)

## About

mmatcher intends to be a simple CLI app to match cases & controls samples
for genetic studies

Matching is done between two CSV files containing an arbritrary number
of columns representing attributes on which to match. We make a poor
attempt to optimize the total number of matched case samples & report
back at most a single control match per case
